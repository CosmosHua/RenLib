The most popular renju software in the world. The function of Renlib is to store analyses 
and games in the special "lib" format. It also has the possibility to write comments on analyses. 
It has a good VCF (victory by continuous fours) search function. Almost every serious renju player
is using renlib as part of their everyday renju study. Besides Renlib software, you can get some 
samples of lib files with opening theories and analyses. Lots of players exchange lib files and
publish the games and analyses collections in lib format in their homepages. In addition to that, 
Renlib can help you to create the Java-based renju diagrams for your website, together with the 
space for comments. Windows XP users should know that their Internet Explorer does not have Java 
support and in that case if you want to create web pages with renju diagrams then you could just
visit www.java.com and install Java support first. Renlib is programmed by Frank Arkbo, Sweden.
